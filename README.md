## LPOO
Repository to host Object Oriented Programming Laboratory second project.

LPOO is a course given at FEUP in the second year of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.
 
## Champions Field
The goal of this project was to develop an android application. Therefore, we decided to create a soccer simulator where the user controls their team players (one at a time) and has to score against the opponent team, which are controlled by another player (Multiplayer Mode) or by an AI (Singleplayer Mode). 

This project was developed in Android Studio and was intended to be be playable in a desktop or android phone. It uses the LibGDX framework to handle the game physics and AI aspects. Regarding the multiplayer mode, we used the [Kryonet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet) library to implement our client/server communication.
